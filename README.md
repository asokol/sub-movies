Movies subtitles analysis.


# Preface: #
Once upon a time, I was bored about long dialog in 199x movie. Eventually, I want to check whether movie dialogues become shorter nowadays comparing with past.

# Progress (Octave(Matlab) prototype): #
1.  *Parse subtitles: extract time spans.*
2.  Build fancy plots of time spans.
3.  Make clusterization to find quantity of dialogues in movie.
4.  Find average/maximum dialogue length per movie for specific year.
	
# Deployment: #
	1.  Install latest version of [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ "Octave").
	2.  Clone repository.
	3.  Run Octave and change to /prototype directory using "cd" command.
	4.  Execute "run_tests" command from Octave.

	
# Future plans: #
Find other relations between dialogues characteristics in movie and movie genre/country of production/acting persons/etc.
