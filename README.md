Movies subtitles analysis.


Preface:
Once upon a time, I was bored about long dialog in 199x movie. Eventually, I want to check whether movie dialogues become shorter nowadays comparing with past.

Progress:
Build Octave(Matlab) prototype:
	- Parse subtitles: extract time spans.
	
	- Build fancy plots of time spans
	
	- Make clusterization to find dialogues count in movie.
	

Future plans:
Find other relations between dialogues characteristics in movie and movie genre/country of production/acting persons/etc.
